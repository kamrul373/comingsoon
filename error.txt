1st Bug
Error : Compiled with problems:X

ERROR in ./src/App.js 17:35-45

export 'default' (imported as 'ComingSoon') was not found in './components/ComingSoon' (possible exports: comingSoon)

Approach : 
1. First Go to mentioned path './components/ComingSoon' 
2. Checking codes and found that components (comingSoon) defined in lowercase and exported without default
3. Found that App.js is importing comingSoon component in upperCase (ComingSoon)

4. So I exported ComingSoon from component as default 

2nd bug:

I saw that time countdown is running negatively which should be positive.
Approach : 
1. I tried to find countdown component and I changed year from 2222 to 2023 so countdown run positively

3. I am not sure is that a bug or I am not allowed to fetch this url, 
Error : http://10.11.50.2:5000/sendemail net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT

I used chrome console and debugger


Thank you for giving me this chance.
